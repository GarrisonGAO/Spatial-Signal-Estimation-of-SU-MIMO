# Spatial-Signal-Estimation-of-SU-MIMO
Spatial Signal Estimation of SU-MIMO, includes sampling, modelling and comparison code

The Sampling file includes code used to generate training samples, you can also find channel modelling in this file.

The Models includes the Tranformer model and CNN models

The Compare file is used to compare the SU-MIMO channel performance in three cases:

  Have virtual antenna
  
  Have ideal virtual antenna 
  
  Don't have virtual antenna
